        <p>The ocean covers 70 percent of Earth's surface. It contains about 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (324 million cubic miles) of water, which is about 97 percent of all the water on Earth. The ocean makes all life on Earth possible, and makes the planet appear blue when viewed from space. Earth is the only planet in our solar system that is definitely known to contain liquid water.

Although the ocean is one continuous body of water, oceanographers have divided it into five principal areas: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern Oceans. The Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans merge into icy waters around Antarctica.</p>

            <h1>First Deep Sea Exploration</h1>
            <h3>1864 Norwegian Research (the spark)</h3>
            <p>The first deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when Norwegian researchers Michael Sars and Georg Ossian Sars obtained a sample of a stalked crinoid at a depth of 3,109 m (10,200 ft). <br></br>
                From 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard HMS Challenger, a screw corvette that was converted into a survey ship in 1872. The Challenger expedition covered 127,653 kilometres (68,927 nmi), and shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples and hydrographic measurements, discovering more than 4,700 new species of marine life, including deep-sea organisms.They are also credited with providing the first real view of major seafloor features such as the deep ocean basins.

            <h1>Technology in Deep Sea</h1>
            <h3>From simple to complex and so on...</h3>
            <p><p>Ocean exploration began with shockingly simple tools. For centuries, the <strong>lead line</strong>, 
                a simple weighted rope marked with intervals, was the <u>only way to measure depth</u>. Navigators used 
                the <strong>sextant</strong> and <strong>chronometer</strong> to pinpoint their location on the vast, 
                empty sea. A huge leap came with sampling tools like the <strong>dredge</strong>, a heavy metal net dragged 
                along the seafloor. The 1870s <i>H.M.S. Challenger</i> expedition used this to <u>discover thousands of new 
                    species</u>, proving the deep sea was not a dead zone. To sample the water itself, they invented the <strong>
                        Nansen bottle</strong>, a clever tube that could snap shut at a specific depth to trap a sample.<br><br>The 
                        20th century brought two game-changers: SONAR and diving. <strong>SONAR</strong> (Sound Navigation and 
                        Ranging) uses sound "pings" to map the seafloor from a ship. It <u>created the first maps of the hidden 
                            underwater world</u>, revealing vast mountain ranges (like the Mid-Ocean Ridge) and deep trenches. 
                            At the same time, <strong>SCUBA</strong>, co-invented by Jacques Cousteau, <u>untethered humans from 
                                the surface</u>, allowing true exploration of coastal ecosystems. For the extreme deep, <strong>
                                    manned submersibles</strong> (HOVs) were built. After early attempts like the cabled Bathysphere, 
                                    the <strong>Bathyscaphe <i>Trieste</i></strong> famously reached the <u>bottom of the Mariana Trench</u> 
                                    in 1960. Modern subs like <strong>DSV <i>Alvin</i></strong> became true workhorses, letting scientists 
                                    directly observe and sample deep-sea life, like hydrothermal vents.<br><br>Today, exploration is 
                                    dominated by advanced robotics. <strong>ROVs</strong> (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are <u>tethered 
                                        robots "flown" by pilots on the ship</u>. With HD cameras and robotic arms, they do precise work, 
                                        from studying vents to examining shipwrecks like the <i>Titanic</i>. <strong>AUVs</strong> 
                                        (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), however, are <u>completely untethered</u>. These pre-programmed 
                                        robots "mow the lawn" to gather mapping data over huge areas. Finally, <strong>satellite oceanography
                                        </strong> lets us scan the <u>entire global ocean surface</u>, tracking sea-surface temperature, height, 
                                        and even plankton blooms from space.</p></p>

            <h1>Discoveries</h1>
            <h3>The top Ocean exploration discoveries</h3>
            <p>
                Ocean exploration has completely changed how we see our planet.
                 For centuries, most people assumed the deep ocean was a <u>cold, dark, 
                and lifeless void</u>. This idea was proven wrong by early voyages like the 
                <strong><i>H.M.S. Challenger</i></strong> expedition (1870s), which dredged 
                up thousands of unknown species from miles deep, proving the deep sea was full 
                of bizarre and varied life.<br><br>But the <u>most stunning discovery</u> came 
                in 1977 with <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong>. Scientists found superheated, 
                mineral-rich water gushing from the seafloor, like underwater geysers. Around these 
                toxic vents, they found a dense ecosystem of giant tube worms, crabs, and shrimp, 
                all thriving in total darkness. This was revolutionary because it was the first 
                discovery of life that doesn't depend on the sun. Instead of photosynthesis, 
                these creatures use <strong>chemosynthesis</strong>, getting energy from the 
                chemicals in the vent water.<br><br>Mapping the seafloor also revealed the 
                <strong>Mid-Ocean Ridge</strong>, a <u>massive underwater mountain range</u> 
                that wraps around the entire globe like the seam on a baseball. This discovery 
                was the key piece of evidence for <strong>plate tectonics</strong>, showing exactly 
                where the Earth's crust is spreading apart.<br><br>More recently, exploration 
                has shown that <u>bioluminescence</u> (animals making their own light) isn't 
                just a rare curiosity; it's the primary language of the deep ocean, used for 
                everything from hunting to hiding. And, of course, exploration has also located 
                our own lost history, like the famous discovery of the <strong><i>RMS Titanic</i></strong>, 
                and has allowed humans to visit the deepest point on Earth, the <strong>Challenger Deep</strong>, 
                nearly seven miles down.
